Prodigy Cyber Security Internship - Task 3 - Password Complexity Checker

Build an online GUI tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

Here’s a simple example of how you could build a password strength checker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool checks for length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

[Please do check out the attached PasswordComplexityChecker.html file.]

In this code, the checkPasswordStrength function is called whenever the user types in the password input field. This function checks the password against various criteria and increments the strength variable accordingly. It then updates the result div with the password strength and changes its color based on the strength.

Please note that this is a very basic password strength checker and might not cover all security considerations for a real-world application. It’s always recommended to use established libraries for password strength checking in production code.
